I wake up to the sounds
Of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around
With my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold
The stories that are told
When my back is to the world
That was smiling when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us
Oh the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready
Your words up on the wall
As you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls
And the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind
And I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like
To be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us
(Huh)
Oh the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y

[JID:]
Uh, look, okay
I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape
Thinkin' out the box
I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock
To cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic, quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up
Who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
